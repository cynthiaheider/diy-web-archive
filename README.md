# "DIY Web Archiving"
A workshop offered by Cynthia Heider and [Rachel Appel](https://www.github.com/rlappel) at People's Media Camp 2025.

## Description
The web is constantly changing, and websites that were here today may be different (or gone!) tomorrow. From news stories to your social media posts - if you want to preserve something on the web for the long haul, you need to take action. That's where web archiving comes in, and anyone can do it. This session will introduce participants to reasons and examples of why and when they might want to DIY web archiving, and a variety of tools, practices, and standards that make it possible and useful for others to access and use. In addition, resources and information about grassroots initiatives doing this work will be amplified. Participants will leave the session empowered to start preserving their own web with guided walkthroughs of how to download their social media history as well as how to archive live webpages with Webrecorder.
